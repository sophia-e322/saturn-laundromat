# Saturn's Laundromat

Saturn's Laundromat is a personal portfolio website I started in highschool! I've improved a lot in coding since then so some of the pages are still being updated and uploaded to github. The published site can be found at: https://saturn-laundromat.neocities.org/

## Pages
* index.html: home page of my website
* coding.html: coding projects I've worked on in the past (some projects have seperate pages that are not uploaded yet)
* art.html: art pieces I've worked on in the past
